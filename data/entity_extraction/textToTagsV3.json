She is a 77-year-old woman with longstanding history of tobacco use of greater than 100-pack years quitting approximately eight years ago. She suffers from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, and what appears to be a recent diagnosis of COPD. She has always been very limited in her activity suffering from back pain, and has never been in any type of regular exercise routine. She recently has noticed dyspnea on exertion over the past two to three months and has been treated with several prednisone tapers as well as an albuterol nebulizer at home and an albuterol inhaler. With these treatments, her dyspnea improved, but would worsen as the steroids were tapered. She does report some episodes of chest heaviness, which she describes as a heavy feeling in her chest, which will last for minutes at a time. These are not exertionally related and are occurring approximately once per week. She was placed on Nexium with some improvement, but does feel as if she will still develop these episodes.",

She presently has had recurrent bouts of a COPD flare, which has been responsive to prednisone and albuterol nebulizer therapy. Her chest CT scan demonstrates plaque in the left main coronary artery as well as a right coronary artery aneurysm. I do believe she needs further evaluation first by functional study, and I will arrange an adenosine stress test and consider cardiac catheterization to further define her anatomy with her multiple high-risk features and abnormalities as seen on her recent CT scan. She will continue a slow taper with possible addition of other inhalers to control her COPD.",

Concern for a stroke-related etiology, either embolic or lacunar, is unlikely given CT and MRI results. However, microembolic disease may be a possibility. Given the relatively rapid onset of symptoms, worsening Alzheimer s dementia is less likely, though often onset of Alzheimer s may appear to have a rapid onset simply because a threshold of recognition by family members has been reached while the process itself was in fact more protracted. As suggested in the CT results, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be a possibility, though the lack of incontinence makes this less likely. LP performed in the ED was diagnostic and not therapeutic for NPH. One further diagnosis to consider would be an encephalopathic process, perhaps due to hypertension.",

He tolerated the procedure uneventfully. His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy. He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge. He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home. Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias.

At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin. In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention. In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center. I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction. He will have routine blood studies obtained today.

He had previously been followed by Dr. Elizabeth Keys at Pioneer Hospital at Findlay until June of this year which time he switched to a new primary care doctor. At that time, he had been on glyburide, metformin and Avandia, his new PCP increased his glyburide and his Avandia. He also stopped his hydrochlorothiazide out of concern that this is not an ideal agent for a diabetic patient. Over the next weeks to months, the patient had progressive peripheral edema, fluid weight gain and ultimately development of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He returned for care and was started on furosemide and has been recently titrated up to a dose of 60 mg orally on this. He self adjusted his Avandia dose from 4 mg twice daily to 2 mg daily. His prebreakfast blood glucose has been elevated ranging from 160-200. He has had some resolution of his fluid overload with the Lasix and lower dose Avandia. He says he has persistent feeling of swelling and tightness in his fingers and toes with episodic ankle swelling as well. He denies chest pain, claudication polyuria, polydipsia. He has been losing weight since starting Lasix. He has never had hypoglycemia.",

Also related, at least in part, to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI in December 2074. Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent- left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting, going away before she has time to try a SLTNG. In addition, Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower, on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis, which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal. She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD. She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low. Using a home machine, Ms. Fallon recorded SBPs in the 80's and complains of frequent periods of dizziness, especially when getting up from the seated position. She is unable to lie flat 2/2 to orthopnea. She denies recent fevers, chills, SOB or chest pain. Lower extremity swelling continues to be a problem and she is complaining of left heel pain.",

She is now under evaluation for pancreatic transplantation. She has not had symptoms of angina or left ventricular dysfunction and LVEF has been normal. An exercise test in July 2087 achieved 79% of the maximal predicted heart rate, no chest discomfort, but 1-mm of ST depression in the lateral leads. Her other recent issues have included marked anemia, possibly related to her immunosuppressive drugs (negative upper and lower endoscopy) and transient hyperglycemia following a glucocorticoid bolus.",

Apparently, he has remained disease free since this time until a PSA was checked this past October which was 3.53. He states that he had not had his PSA checked for a few years before this, admittedly perhaps because he had missed appointments. The Urologists at the BNH have since checked a bone scan and abdominal CT scan, all of which were negative. He has the reports here with him. The bone scan does show an abnormality at L5, but with data from plain films this appears to not be consistent with a met lesion. He also has had recurrent problems with bleeding from hemorrhagic radiation cystitis. This occurs once every few months or so and is not currently bothering him.

Baseline EKG was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ETT was positive with inverted T waves, ST segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and PVC s in recovery. The patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ETT, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue. On the Myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal. Estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%. A subsequent exercise echo was normal. Baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180. His blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his PCP in August.

The chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.

The differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, GERD/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal/chest wall pain, and anxiety. The sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as MI, aortic dissection, or PE. The patient has elevated D-Dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of DVT) or CT/CTA imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism. The patient s HTN is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative CXR and CTA scans, which have 80 95% sensitivity. In addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur. The distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin. Moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors. This makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.",

She continued to feel poorly (she is somewhat vague on symptoms but reports feeling that her chest was congested and that she may have had some palpitations and felt chilled). She saw a police cruiser, and walked over to it with the intention of getting help. When she arrived, there was no one in the car, and she leaned forward to rest her head on the front of the car. This is the last thing she remembered; when she awoke, she was surrounded by people. She was told that she had falled backwards and hit the back of her head. When EMS found her, she was confused, making repetitive statements, and stating that she had pain in her occiput that radiated down her neck. When she arrived at the FMH ED, her blood pressure was 213/97 HR 84 RR20 O2 sat 99% RA Temp 97.3. She received Labetolol 20 iv, Toradol 30 mg iv, ASA 325 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg po x 1. Her mental status cleared somewhat, and her blood pressure came down to 130s/80s.

He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg. If he shifts to his right leg, he gets a similar discomfort one or two minutes later. This is relieved by sitting. It will happen when walking as well. This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy. He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls. Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist.",

He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy. There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy. I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors. I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief. He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications. I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.",

At the time of this stenting, he had total occlusion of his midRCA and mid circumflex with collaterals. He presented with recurrent CP in May, and he underwent a second cath that revealed patent LAD with stent. This admission he had a 10-15 minute episode of chest and jaw pain with tachycardia and hypertension by home monitoring. The pain resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerins. He went to Butte Ridge Associates where he was placed on heparin. In the setting of heparin bolus with PPT >150, he had one episode, moderate volume of painless rectal bleeding. Since transfer, still on heparin, he had no further bleeding, nor guiac positive stool until today. This morning he passed a large brown bowel movement which was guiac negative. Following this, after returning to bed, he had a small amount of oozing of blood from his rectum. He had no abdominal pain. No further bleeding since this morning. He has never had rectal bleeding previously on aspirin and plavix. His colonoscopy in 2066 revealed diverticulosis. He is currently on aspirin, plavix, heparin with therapeutic PTT.",

It is also noted that his blood pressure fell, but normalized during exercise. The patient has been stable until last several weeks when he has noted some lower jaw symptoms anteriorly. He has no chest squeezing, neck squeezing, or jaw pain, but there is an odd sensation under the front teeth. He correlates this with exercise, but not consistently. He also occasionally feels this at rest. He is able to walk uphill and generate a pulse of 90. He is working doing heavy labor in the garden, moving, and digging. It is not clear that this represents angina, but we will let Dr. Null know. He is seeing Dr. Null in three to four weeks. 01/13/2072: .

He states his exercise tolerance is steadily improving and he is able to walk 2 miles at a rate of 17 minutes per mile without dyspnea or fatigue. He has no chest pain or palpitations. He does worry about bradycardia and states his metoprolol of 50 mg BID may be too much. He has been withholding half to full dose in the evenings when he finds his pulses about 50. He has no symptoms of forgetfulness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness. He does have cold extremities. There is no weight gain, weight loss, or orthopnea.

This catheterization revealed 60% LAD lesion, 50% first marginal, 60% RCA, and a 70% diagonal lesion. She was maintained on medical management with few symptoms. She has been lost to followup from Cardiology Clinic. She has within the last week developed increasing symptoms with minimal exertion. She underwent a stress test in which she was able to exercise for 6 minutes and 9 seconds on the Bruce protocol. She achieved 93% of age-predicted maximal heart rate. At 4 minutes, she developed 2 mm ST segment depressions in the anterior leads associated with chest discomfort. She is a vague historian, but has not had clear rest anginal symptoms.",

In retrospect, he has had these changes for many years, and anyway he had a cardiac catheterization, which showed mild obstruction of some of his coronary systems but no evidence of coronary artery syndrome. He did have cardiomyopathy with the ejection fraction of 35%. He was sent home on Toprol XL 50 mg QD, Lipitor 10 mg QD, lisinopril 10 mg, aspirin 325 mg once a day, and Avandia 2 mg once a day. Since returning home, the patient feels no chest pain or shortness of breath. No orthopnea or PND. He still has a dry cough.",

Exercise test was also put in place and the exercise results are now available as well as the echocardiography that had been scheduled at that time. He still has occasional ankle swelling, but is able to walk without discomfort. He has gained some weight over the summer and is having difficulties staying away from salty foods, particularly he likes pastrami. He is no longer using a CPAP.",

There is a discrepancy between the ejection fraction on the echo and I suspect that has to do with differences in technique. I have talked with the patient about cardiac catheterization and I would like to get him in for that as soon as possible so we can assess the degree of coronary disease. Hopefully it is amenable to percutaneous angioplasty, but I am somewhat concerned about the left ventricular aneurysm. We will arrange for cardiac catheterization either next week or the following week and I will plan to see him back here in the office approximately a month which will be after his catheterization and hopeful angioplasty.",

In brief, the patient is a 81 y/o man with CRI, Type II DM and hypertension who was in his USOH until Thursday evening, when he developed substernal chest pain around 7pm, associated with dyspnea, but no radiation diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting. The pain lasted approximately 15-20 minutes. EMS was called, who brought him to the HCC ED, where he was found to be tachypneic, with an O2 of 85%. His pain was alleviated with IV NTG, and BiPap improved his O2 saturation. He was found to have an interventricular conduction delay and a positive troponin. He was begun on aspirin, lopressor, lasix, heparin, and integrelin and sent to the cath lab, where he was found to have 3-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous interventions. He was sent to the SDU, where he was started on lasix 60IV BID and a CABG pre-op workup was begun. Since admission to the SDU, he has been stable, with excellent RA sats. His Troponin-T peaked at 2.91 and was slow to return to normal, 2.65 on last draw today. He was diuresed aggressively and transferred to the floor with no oxygen requirement, having no chest pain.",

This is very likely to be consistent with lymphoma. I discussed lymphoma in general terms with the patient and his son. I informed them that many lymphomas were treatable and some of them would indeed be curable. This would all depend on the exact histology that was revealed by biopsy. These sites of biopsy would be the left inguinal region. I informed them that the treatments that would be considered would include either antibodies, chemotherapy or radiation and these would depend significantly on the type of lymphoma that was found. The fact that there are no B symptoms and that he feels relatively well might indicate that this is a low-grade lymphoma. However, the relatively rapid onset of his leg swelling in the left leg may be more consistent with a higher-grade process. I feel that his left-sided edema is very likely due to decreased lymphatic drainage from the left leg. However, further discussion of his lymphoma will have to wait final pathology.

About three to four weeks ago, this became increasingly evident and the patient was evaluated at Elders Home in Brandon, Indiana. At that point, a CT scan was performed. CT scan of the abdomen revealed significant adenopathy in the retroperitoneal space with a 2.0 cm node between the IVC in aorta and a 1.5 cm node just posterior to that, also a 1.0 cm retrocrural node was seen. CT scan of the pelvis performed on the same day revealed a chain of retrocrural nodes in front of the aorta and vena cava extending to about 2.0 to 3.0 cm below the bifurcation as well as bulky adenopathy in the external iliac chain with an iliac mass measuring 3.0 to 3.5 cm in diameter on the left side. The largest node in the inguinal area measures approximately 6.0 cm in diameter.

He presented in early April where CT and PET scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a 6.0 cm inguinal node, a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space, adenopathy in the external iliac chain (largest 3.5 cm), and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the IVC and aorta. He underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing DLBCL confimed by immunophenotyping. Subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal B-cell populations and an inverted CD4/CD8 T Cell ratio, with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation. The patient underwent his initial two cycles of CHOP in May, and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness. PET exam in early June revealed larger left groin mass, improvement in lymphadenopathy, and a small pancreatic cystic lesion.

Given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to CHOP, the patient was evaluated by Dr. Rodgers of the WDMC one week later on 7/28 for consideration of auto-SCT vs more aggressive chemo regimen. Due to the patient's age and consideration of risk/benefit, it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first. Mr. Nielson was admitted on 8/2/2097 to receive his first cycle of R-ICE with dose-reduced Ifos and carboplatin becuase of h/o nephrectomy. He tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia. Patient felt the R-ICE regimen was a little harder on him than the CHOP regimen. He felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days. On 8/9, he was given 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia and on 8/16, he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia. He was initially scheduled to receive cycle 2 of R-ICE on 8/22 but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia. He says that he currently feels cold-intolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in May.

Since last seen, she apparently was without evidence of increasing BUN and creatinine and for this reason was advised to transiently hold both her lisinopril and Zaroxolyn. By doing so, her creatinine fell from 2.2 to 1.6 and BUN from 117 to 57. She subsequently has resumed her lisinopril therapy, as apparently her blood pressure increased off her ACE inhibitor. In addition, as part of her followup last March, she underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test during which time she achieved a peak heart rate of 65, peak blood pressure of 129/50, stopping because she reached the end of the adenosine infusion protocol. Her gated SPECT imaging demonstrated a global left ventricular ejection fraction of 38% with a mildly dilated left ventricle and akinesis of the basal inferoseptal and entire inferior wall. Her rest-stress perfusion imaging showed similarly a large fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and basal inferoseptal wall without any area of reversible ischemia. Her last echocardiogram performed in July 2071 showed a residual of left ventricular ejection fraction mildly reduced at 45% with severe inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis. In addition, at that time showed evidence for trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and her echo was essentially unchanged from her prior study in March 2071.",

I have asked her to decrease her Toprol-XL to 25 mg p.o. daily and to repeat an EKG four to five days after doing so. I of course have reminded her as to the importance of getting in contact with you or myself straight away should she develop any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or dizziness. She understands that she may require a permanent pacemaker in the future. Most recent blood studies show a significantly elevated glucose of 183 (she states she is trying to tailor her insulin regimen with you) and in January, normal liver function studies except for an alkaline phosphatase of 304 and lipid profile last September notable for a cholesterol of 134, triglyceride of 74, HDL 58, and LDL 61. She understands the importance of continuing to adhere to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet while remaining on her antilipemic therapy. She will discuss with you and her nephrologist the optimal management of her mild renal insufficiency. In light of both her diabetes and coronary disease, it certainly would be optimal if possible to continue her on her ACE inhibitor. At the present time, she does not meet criteria for prophylactic placement of an AICD and her New York Heart Association class I to II status precludes the need for consideration of biventricular pacing. Other than reducing her beta-blocker regimen as described above, I have not further altered her current medical program.",

This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours. She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself. The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline. In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.

This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours. She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself. In particular she related several examples of semantic paraphasic errors. The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline. In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated. She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait. She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect. She recalled one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed. The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up. She has no known history of seizures but migraines occur 1-2x/year, last 30 minutes to several hours and are typically preceeded by scintillating scotoma ( jagged horizontal lines ), associated with nausea/photophobia, and relieved by sleep.",

Since discharge, she has continued to have her baseline migraines at a frequency of ~ 2x/month. At this point, we would not recommend beginning prophylactic therapy, but would consider doing so if attacks become more frequent. Given her clinical response to Excedrin migraine, we have suggested continuing this drug for abortive therapy, but have spoken at length about the phenomenon of rebound headache and cautioned her about using it more than once every 10-14 days. We have discussed the phenomenon of complex migraine and reinforced the inherent difficulties of distinguishing these attacks from TIA/stroke; thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non-stereotyped deficits seriously. She will follow-up with us in 4-6 months or sooner if the need arises.",

His symptoms were related to loss of feeling in his right upper extremity. About this time, he also developed a traumatic lesion of the left second toe. He apparently develops some cellulitis and was treated with ampicillin. Not long after this, he went into renal failure.

The source of GBS bacteremia remains unclear although she had an episode of shingles a few weeks prior and may have caused a cutaneous innoculation. Pre-op angiogram showed no significant CAD. On 4/5/89 she underwent composite aortic root replacement with a 20mm life net aortic homograft by Dr. Jerome. Due to heavily calcified RCA ostium, a button for re-implantation couldn't be created so she recieved a single vessel SVG to prox RCA. Post op course was complicated by afib with high grade AV block for which she recieved a dual chamber PPM. She was discharged to rehab with a PICC to complete a course of IV PCN. However, she was re-admitted in early May while still at rehab with an episode of chest pain at rest. ECG was paced but biomarkers were mildly positive (troponin ~0.5). TTE showed the valve was well seated without suggestion of recurrent endocarditis. There was a new apical WMA. She underwent cath which showed patent BPG and no significant CAD. The episode was attributed to embolic phenomenon (? from afib, INR 1.5 on admission). She was discharged back to rehab and has done well since.",

At that time, he had been evaluated by Dr. Morgan Thayer, who performed a stress MIBI and demonstrated an inferoposterior ischemia, a low workload of 3 minutes and 18 seconds, and a heart rate of only 72% of predicted. The LV chamber was dilated, and the ejection fraction was estimated at 48%, and there was a suggestion of global ischemia. The catheterization demonstrated the presence of moderate diffuse coronary artery disease, plaque distributed throughout much of the coronary tree, some calcification, and narrow caliber vessels overall, but no focal high-grade stenoses. There was some disease in the distal left main coronary artery, but his angina or ischemia was felt to be on the basis of excess demand in the phase of globally diminished supply.",

PURPOSE(S): Diagnosis of ischemia. DIAGNOSES: Primary diagnosis is chestpain. Additional diagnoses include hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia. MEDICATIONS: Albuterol, ECASA, Furosemide, Lopressor, Losartan. PROCEDURE: The patient underwent an adenosine stress test with exercise. Maximum adenosine dose: 140 ucg/kg/min. Supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec). 1 lb hand held weight 1097MBq 99mTc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired. Additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406MBq 99mTc sestamibi at rest on the same day. Global LVEF was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made. STRESS TEST RESULTS: DURATION @ MAX DOSE (min:sec) 5:00 HR (REST=>MAX) 56 => 74 (50% PREDICTED) BP (INITIAL=>PEAK) 150/60 => 150/60 (MINIMUM = 130/x) PEAK DOUBLE PRODUCT: 11100 ENDPOINT(S): The protocol was completed. Chest pain did not occur. REST ECG: The rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific ST segment and T-wave abnormalities. Sinus bradycardia 56/min. First degree AVB STRESS ECG: No ST segment changes were observed during this test. Arrhythmias: None STRESS TEST COMMENTS Negative for ischemia. However, the sensitivity of Adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting significant CAD is limited. SCAN RESULTS: The left ventricle is normal in size. There is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study. Regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study. CONCLUSIONS: The ECG response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia. The myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--LVEF=50%.",

He is a lovely 53 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for Hodgkins, status post mantle radiation in the early 70's; coronary artery disease, status post-PCI to the LAD and RCA in '90 and '87, respectively, and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer. MIBI done at LMC 1/24/94 showed normal EF without perfusion defects (no scar or ischemia); he exercised 10:30 on a standard Bruce iwthout symptoms. He was admitted 2/94 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer (ASA was stopped 1 week prior to surgery; he was not on plavix preop); in PACU following resection, he had a VT/VF arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his RCA. After extensive suction catheter use and POBA, a good angiographic result was obtained; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in. Remarkably, echocardiogram revealed normal LV systolic function, with basal inferoposterior HK noted. His peak TnI was 33.6, his peak CK was 1710, and his peak MB was 87.2. He had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident. He was discharged 2/11/94, and returns today for routine follow-up.",

Our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events. Given the degree of thrombus burden in his RCA at the time of cath, he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin. Furthermore, he is not someone for whom I would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that ANY future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix. His blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records. I have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 200 bid to toprol 200 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade, but otherwise, would not make any changes to his regimen at this time.

As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors. He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT/VF arrest. He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight. He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%. His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA. He has subsequently had a VT/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results. He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis. In 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results. Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily lifelong.",

Immediate angiography post-resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery, with good result after thrombectomy and POBA, in addition to Integrilin, aspirin, Plavix, and low dose heparin. Remarkably, after an IABP and aggressive care Nick walked away with a preserved LV function after this event. He did well until 01/2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in-stent restenosis in the ostial LAD and the ostial RCA bare-metal stents. He was treated with Cypher drug-eluting stents to both lesions (3.5 x 18 mm Cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the LAD and 3.5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of Valsalva to the RCA) with no residual stenosis. Because of concerns with regards to recurrent in-stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy (325mg ECASA and clopidogrel 150 mg) since that event intended as longterm therapy. He has been followed by me since 2095 with no recurrent ischemic heart disease, chest pain, and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function.",

He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left. However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side. This lasted for ~24 hours. He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis. He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx. He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM. On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.",

She denies any drainage, erythema, or increased swelling or warmth in the foot. Her orthotics were made in September and seem to be working quite well for her. She admits however that over the last month and half or so that she has been wearing boots that her current orthotics do not fit in.

I am going to have her see Samantha Albright, our orthotist to have the insoles remolded with Plastizote. I have asked Ms. Xayarath to bring the shoes that she typically wears as well as the boots she wears.

He describes the weakness as lack of energy and has normal muscle strength. He states he really didn't have any symptoms other than weakness, but when asked about chest pain, he notes that he had mild chest discomfort, which was analogous to catching his breath after exercise. He also describes some mild lightheadedness. He has 2 pillow orthopnea, but he denies any fever, chills, nausea, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, syncope, HA, dyspnea, chest pain, PND, diaphoresis, palpitations, or any other concerning symptoms. He notes his last BM was on Friday morning and states his stools have not been black or tarry, bright red, pencil thin, or watery. He denies any abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. He notes that rest and staying out of the heat improved his symptoms, while exertion worsened his symptoms. He has had these symptoms before in March of this year, but his symptoms today are more mild than when he presented then. At that time he had symptoms of weakness and lightheadedness especially when standing, and he was found to have a Hct of 24.9. He was guiac positive and was sent for a colonoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy, where a he was found to have erosive esophagitis and two cecal polyps. The bowel prep on the colonoscopy was poor and he was asked to follow up with a repeat colonoscopy. He was sent home on iron supplements and a PPI. Of note, his previous colonoscopies had shown tubulovillous adenomas including a 25 mm polyp that could not be fully resected and had been Before this admission he was seen by his worksite nurse who sent him to his PCP. Dr. David Napolitano at Kessel Group Home saw him and transferred him to SMI for workup of severe anemia (Hct 25.4 MCV 75), dizziness, and orthostasis.",

His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office. His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER. He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically. Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez. Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal. Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia. He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary. His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted. He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension. Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation. His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.",

Atenolol could certainly be a factor in this as well and perhaps a different antihypertensive medication could be considered or it could be discontinued altogether.

He was prescribed sitz baths and Keflex for pilonidol cyst vs. ruptured boil. He was seen again in EDUCARE-PULLMAN on 1/29/77 at which time he reported resolution of his buttock pain. He denied fevers or neurologic symptoms. Exam was notable for only a tiny pustule in the upper gluteal cleft, minimally erythematous, non-tender, without drainage. On the morning of 2/01/77 he developed worsening of his shortness of breath, followed by the development of left jaw pain, and cold sweats, so he presented to the MANAMANA ED. On presentation, he also admitted to three days of scrotal and perineal pain and swelling. In the ED he was tachycardic to 113, normotensive, initially low-grade fever, but later spiked to 102.9. On examination, there was severe bilateral testicular swelling and pain, with a fluctuant mass between the rectum and scrotum. His WBC was 18,000 with 91% PMNs. An abdominal CT revealed extensive subcutaneous edema in the perineum, with multiple foci of air consistent with a necrotizing infection; and extensive fluid in the scrotum, consistent with Fournier's gangrene. The patient was treated with IV Abx and was taken urgently to the OR, where he underwent extensive debridement at which time substantial necrosis and pus were discovered. He was admitted to the SICU and has since undergone multiple debridements, last on 2/20/77.",

Dr. Prince had arranged involuntary hospitalization for this pt with campus security and EMS, prior to his arrival for the appointment. However, per Mr. Vaughn, he arrived to the appointment only with the expectation of discussing his depression and refilling his Celexa, which he has been unable to take for the past 2 weeks, due to an expired prescription. Dr. Prince documents a discussion in which the pt was tearful and emotional, while describing active suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose on oxycodone. He reportedly had several episodes this past week, where he had more than a hundred oxycodone pills in his hand, but did not follow through on his plans.

All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis. Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB. His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control. He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid. His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen. The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.

She was missing her medication or taking too much medication at times, including her insulin. She also became paranoid when efforts were made to intervene to assist her. Her family notes that this seemed to begin after her gabapentin dose was increased to 600 mg bid. She was also taking some other drugs at the time that affect the central nervous system, including trazodone, benzodiazepines, and narcotics for back pain. She was admitted to the geriatric psychiatry unit at Mid Coast in January 2065. She stayed there for almost a week. According to the family, some medications were discontinued and donepazil was started. Also, they think she had a brain MRI. She improved and was ultimately discharged. She has done much better since discharge. She went with family to Michigan. They report that there she was much better, playing water volleyball last week. Her husband is now supervising her medications. He still notices some memory loss, but this has improved since her discharge. She has had frequent headaches.

We discussed the possibility of changing from NPH to Lantus insulin, but elected to continue her NPH for now. We discussed that her use of the ultra-fast acting insulin does not quite make sense. She is taking an injection in the evening, long after her meal. I asked her to describe her meals and she has carbohydrates essentially with every meal. I think initially she can easily tolerate 10 units of Humalog with each meal. She notes that she prefers to inject the insulin after she eats, which is acceptable as long she does it within a few minutes of the meal. She currently is using an average of 15 units, so this will increase her total daily insulin use by just 15 units. I asked her to check 3 fingersticks a day for me and to e-mail them on a daily basis to start. She will check a fasting fingerstick. She will check a fingerstick before her evening meal, which is her largest meal of the day. She will check a fingerstick 2 hours after her evening meal. She does not need to check a fingerstick right before bed. She will stop using Humalog right before bed and only use the NPH at that time. We discussed the importance of cholesterol treatment. Her last LDL was over 100. I would like to revisit the idea of using a statin. I will repeat her CK level to see if this remains elevated. Her blood pressure on recheck is acceptable. I will see her back in the office in 2 months rather than what is booked now. Most of our visit today took place together with her husband.

We are asked to consult for periop risk eval prior to ORIF.1. Periop cardiac risk: Pt&#8217;s RCRI is zero, and has no Hx CAD. Now, as she as in RVR to 140s, she has no ST depressions. Pt does not need periop beta blockade from a risk perspective, but should continue on home beta blockade given her HTN and now new AF.2. new AF: pt is now in new AF/RVR, asymptomatic, after missing her AM atenolol. She is getting 5mg IV lopressor plus 25 mg po lopressor in the ED, hopefully this will provide some rate control. She should continue on BB.- try 37.5 mg lopressor q8h; hold for HR &lt;60, SBP &lt;100- it is possible that arrhythmia may precipitate falls. She may benefit from a holter monitor as an outpatient, to see whether she is frequently in AF, or whether this was precipitated by illness and missing BB (more likely).- keep pt on tele while in house3. Hx NMS/serotonin syndrome: pt carries a dx of NMS from prior med use the last time she was hospitalized for hip surgery (see CAS notes 11/16/77). However, pt is elderly and with hx of dementia, is at risk for postop dementia. Given this, avoid anti-dopaminergic meds like haldol, seroquel, zydis/zyprexa, reglan. This pt tolerates small doses of benzo as a home med, therefore pt can try:- home klonopin 0.25mg po bid standing- ativan 0.5 mg q6h prn agitation- monitor for signs of NMS: mental status changes with muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability. Check CK if this happens and page med consult 06885 if any concerns.Thank you for this consult. We will follow with you.__________________________________Peggy Ellis, PGY-2 Pager #75412",

The patient was diagnosed with dementia by his PCP about 3 years ago and has been relatively stable living at home (on 2nd floor) in Keystone Heights with his wife who has been his primary caretaker; their two sons are very involved as well. Over the last 6 months they have noticed increasing confusion, agitation, and labile emotions. They noted he has been confused about location, time (recalls distant past but not recent past), and has occasionally not been able to identify his wife. He has become emotionally labile and sometimes agitated. His son notes that he recently had to physically force him to sit down and take his medications. His wife has had to stay up at night to watch the patient to make sure he did not wander. They are particularly worried about his ability to take the flight of stairs to their home since it takes him about 15 min to get up and appears unsteady. About 1 wk ago, while his wife was out of their home, he wandered out and locked himself out; when she returned he angrily accused her of locking him out. Their mother has had increasing difficulty caring for him and has called the 2 sons for help daily for the past week. They called his PCP about these accelerating changes and he was started on lorazepam 0.5-1mg Q4h prn which brought mild improvement. Out of concern for his father's and mother's safety they brought him to the ED for evaluation and placement which their PCP has already begun to discuss with them.",

Given his atheroembolic phenomenon he had very limited vasculature remaining in the foot and I was concerned that the forefoot gangrene would progress and he would wind up losing the right foot. In the interim since his discharge he appears to be doing quite well. The gangrene of the right foot has remained stable with clearcut demarcation of the right first, second and third toes. He also has some heel ulceration that I am hoping to nurse through. He denies any rest pain or pain in the foot. He has no evidence of fevers, chills, rigors or shakes in the interim. He has since been discharged to home and has been walking with a walking shoe. His left lower extremity aneurysm is yet to be treated and he has not developed any symptoms with regards to the left lower extremity. He has been taking his Coumadin regularly and has had therapeutic INRs as he reports.",

This culminated in a fall in July prompting her hospitalization. During that hospitalization a head CT on 7/25/03 was reported unremarkable. (There is mild ventriculomegaly on it.) An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus. There was no abnormal enhancement. This was consistent with small vessel stroke. EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features. An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC. CSF ACE was normal. Cultures were negative. CSF VDRL was negative. Because she has a history of sarcoidosis, it was thought that this likely represented neurosarcoidosis. She was started on prednisone 40 mg daily. Her daughter has noted some improvement in her movements and cognition since starting the prednisone, but she remains abnormal. She has lowered the prednisone to 10 mg daily now. Reviewing the laboratory studies today, I see that although an RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab. She and her daughter are aware of no prior history of syphilis. Other studies during her hospitalization included low serum Na (133) and Mg (1.3), normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20). CSF HSV PCR was negative. HbA1C was elevated at 8.6.",

Since syphilis, too, could cause noncaseating granulomas, and she has clearly has syphilis at some point in the past which was probably untreated, this raises some doubt about the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. I will review that issue with you and with Dr, Villalpando. She had CSF pleocytosis in July. With that and the positive treponemal test (FTA), she will need a full course of intravenous penicillin for presumed neurosyphilis. I will discuss arrangements for possible outpatient management of hatt with a PICC line and outpatient VNA services. Concerning her need for prednisone, I think that will depend on our interpretation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in light of this new diagnosis. If the evidence of sarcoidosis is not strong with this alternative diagnosis, then we can plan to complete the course of penicillin and taper and discontinue the prednisone and then follow her clinical course, her CSF, and her syphilis serologies.",

She should also have an MRI as a thalamic or frontal stroke is another possible etiology.

The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel. If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge. However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control.

Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation. Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability. Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study. If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days). After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG. She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.",

Her MIBI showed no evidence of scar or ischemia and an ejection fraction of 57%. On the other hand, her blood sugars were found to be in the 300-400s. Since then, she has been followed by the IM dept. She comes in today complaining of 2 main symptoms that have been occuring for several months now, and which in large part led to her recent hospitalization: 1) dyspnea that occurs on average twice a week, allevaited after 30 min of SL NTG, no precipitating factors identified. SOB not significantly imporved by albuterol. 2) neck pain, localized to the lateral aspects of her neck. She feels \"her veins exploding\". Of note, she suffered left ankle pain, for which she self-medicated cephalexin (without knowing its an Abx), which she had at home. She says most of her symptoms resolved.

About that time she was prescribed Amoxicillin and Metronidazole, presumably for H. pylori eradication (not confirmed); she reports an adverse reaction to amoxicillin with rash and facial swelling. The meds were discontinued and she started a course of oral methylprednisolone. She stopped this several weeks ago because it made her jittery. Approximately the same time she began to notice that food and pills would feel stuck in the throat; on further questioning, she also may have noted the presence of white spots in the mouth around this time as well. No fevers, chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, headache, lightheadedness, vertigo, rash or new joint pain; no recent travel. She does note that her blood sugars at home have been consistently elevated to the 200-300 range.",

The dizziness was alleviated by him lying down. He added that he began feeling dizzy during the storm last week when his drinking water was contaminated. He drank tap water until he was told it was undrinkable, then he stopped. He later developed diarrhea while not drinking any water and only having occasional Coca-cola beverages. During these 2 weeks of dizziness, Mr. Ishida notes he felt that he lost 3-4 days of his life, saying that he was either knocked out or unconscious. He came to this conclusion b/c his medication box was still full for the previous 3 days; supporting his reflection by saying he rarely ever misses his medication. Mr. Ishida states that the room was not spinning and said that his dizziness was more like &#8220;lightheadness.&#8221; He feels that his problems began when taking Tylenol- 2 weeks ago and cannot identify any other medication that is associated with his symptoms.

With his obstructive sleep apnea and abdominal girth the chances of him objectively putting his legs up so they are higher than his belly or heart are nonexistent. Certainly it is not unreasonable to use a Lymphapress machine to help remove some of the swelling and edema that this patient experiences in his legs, however a Lymphapress is not a maintenance device but is an interventional device. If we do not have a plan as to what to put on his legs after the Lymphapress is removed in between treatments it will be of no long-term benefit. I would recommend that he use a Lymphapress machine and intermittent wraps with 6 to 8 inch ACE wraps. I would always make the tension in the ACE wraps at the level of the ankle and heel greater than the midcalf. I have given him a prescription for a Lymphapress machine as well as ACE wraps and discussed the relevant components of his care, which are important. I hope that these interventions will help him with his lower extremity edema and swelling. It is unlikely that any intervention at the level of his veins will overcome the terrible hydrostatic pressure of his abdomen and total body girth.

As you may know, he is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, former tobacco use, morbid obesity, no family history of early coronary disease and no known coronary disease. He was presented to the Cardiovascular Clinic today for preoperative evaluation prior to an orthopedic surgery scheduled for later on this week by Dr. Phillip Isaac Crosby, at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation Center. This gentleman has a torn ligament in his right hip and is scheduled for laparoscopic repair at the Lamoni Nursing Rehabilitation. Mr. Rivers, as mentioned, denies any history of known coronary artery disease. He has had a prior stress test greater than 15 years ago, but none recently. He denies any recent catheterization or echocardiogram. He works currently as a floor coverer in Shelton and has done so for 20 years. He is able to ambulate approximately two flights of steps, but at the top of the steps develops slight dyspnea on exertion, unclear whether or not this is related to a cardiac etiology or secondary to his morbid obesity with his weight over 400 pounds. He denies any heart failure symptoms, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema or nocturia though he has been maintained on Lasix diuresis in the past though none currently. Additionally, he has poorly controlled diabetes for which he is being followed in the Diabetes Clinic here at the KCM as well as poorly controlled hypertension for which he is on multiple agents. He denies any history of exertional chest discomfort and as mentioned, he is still quite active despite his BLANK as an Interior Designs floor coverer.",

        "input": "Impression: Mr. Rivers is a very pleasant 47-year-old gentleman with multiple cardiac risk factors, notably insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as poorly controlled hypertension with no known coronary artery disease now presenting for cardiovascular clearance prior to elective hip repair scheduled for three days from now. This gentleman has no known coronary disease and has a reasonable exercise capacity, which I estimate to be 3 to 5 METS. Most recently, given his hip and orthopedic issues, he has been unable to ambulate even to three METS. However, prior to his orthopedic injury several months ago, he was able to ambulate up two flights of steps with only minimal dyspnea upon reaching the top step and without any exertional chest discomfort. However, given his multiple risk factors, notably his poorly controlled diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension as well as former tobacco use, he certainly is at very high risk for obstructive coronary disease. As such, I recommended we obtain a Persantine PET stress test for tomorrow morning. If this test is normal without any high risk features or without any evidence for obstructive coronary disease, it would be reasonable for him to proceed with surgery later on this week. This test will also suffice for his upcoming gastric laparoscopic bypass surgery, which is scheduled for 01/2074. With regards to his medication, his blood pressure still is not at goal below 130. As such, I have increased his Toprol-XL from 125 mg to 200 mg p.o. daily. This medication should be continued through all surgery. Additionally, if this is not sufficient in bringing his blood pressure down below 130, I would recommend the addition of a diuretic to his regimen either Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. daily. Additionally, it will be essential that his diabetes be taken better control of and he is now working closely with the diabetes center here at the KCM to do so. His last A1c was approximately 13 and this is certainly way out of range for someone of his young age. I am hopeful with continued medical therapy this gentleman can continue to improve his life and undergo orthopedic surgery as well as gastric bypass surgery with significant improvement to his quality of life and future cardiac risk. With regards to his hypertension, he is on multiple agents including Toprol-XL, Aldactone, Avapro and minoxidil. Given the multitude of agents, it would be reasonable to screen this gentleman for secondary causes of hypertension including hyperthyroidism as well as hyperaldosteronism, but notably he has currently started the Aldactone and this would be difficult to do while on the medication. We could consider in the future, if his blood pressure is not well controlled either washing out the Aldactone and then followed by renin and aldosterone testing versus BLANK sampling in the future if deemed necessary. Additionally, if he is found to have coronary artery disease, one other option despite his lack of claudication would be evaluation of renal artery stenosis. As mentioned, I will obtain the stress imaging tomorrow morning and then we will be able to have a better assessment of whether or not it would be reasonable to proceed with surgery in the near future. I will follow back with him in approximately several months' time for followup of his general cardiovascular care.",

As you know, she has a long and complex history of peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts. Her left lower extremity bypass graft had occluded once previously, but was successfully restored by Dr. Tejeda. In 02/61, we had detected a high-grade stenosis in the distal aspect of this graft by surveillance, and she underwent revision with a local patch angioplasty. A subsequent ultrasound study done in 04/61 showed a widely patent graft and she has remained entirely asymptomatic. She is not particularly active. She denies any rest pain in the feet or significant claudication symptoms. Recently, however, her husband had noticed some cyanosis of her left toes. She remains on low dose aspirin in addition to Lipitor and her other medications. She is a nonsmoker.",

At the present time, she does not have any clear-cut symptoms of critical limb ischemia, though the slight discoloration of her toes is a clear sign. The previous history of this graft including a prior thrombosis requiring thrombectomy and multiple revisions would not board well for any attempted thrombolysis or repeated rescue of this particular conduit. Conversely, she has already had all of her lower extremity veins used for bypass operations and any redo bypass would be technically complicated. I will need to review her previous angiograms from earlier this year to determine the status of her runoff and what the alternatives might be. At the present time, however, she appears to have marginal, though reasonable collateralization and is essentially asymptomatic. I think it would be reasonable to increase her antithrombotic therapy and I added a daily dose of Plavix to supplement a baby aspirin. I spent sometime discussing the signs of worsening ischemia including more diffuse cyanotic skin changes of the toes, rest pain, or ulceration. At a minimum, I will see her back in two months for reexamination, but I strongly encouraged the patient and her husband to contact us soon if there are any symptoms that suggest worsening of her circulation. If her collateralization can remain stable, it certainly would be preferable to avoid having to consider a complex redo bypass with very limited remaining vein in this patient.",

She had no respiratory symptoms of dyspnea or cough. A chest x-ray was obtained, which revealed a 6 cm left lung mass. The patient subsequently had a CT scan. The CT scan revealed a 4 x 6 lung mass in the posterior subsegment of the right upper lobe. There were some modestly enlarged hilar nodes, but all below 2 cm. She has some tiny sub 5 mm nodules in both lungs. The patient is referred by her primary care physician, Dr. Jordon for further evaluation. The patient has no history of lung .

Sometimes he feels a little catch and a fleeting moment of shortness of breath. Of note, he was admitted to the hospital last week for these symptoms. He was admitted, I think 01/15-01/16. He was ruled out for an MI and actually had a stress test, which showed no evidence of ischemia. Furthermore, he was monitored the entire time, including while he was having this symptom of a funny feeling in his chest followed by a little shortness of breath or catching his breath as he describes it and no arrhythmia was documented whatsoever. He was ultimately discharged from the hospital with the diagnosis of Costa chondritis. He is describing this pain in his left neck and he wonders if it is somehow related to the pain in his chest. He said he tried gargling with mouthwash some and that did seem to help a little. This neck or throat pain has been going on for the past three days.",

Almost simultaneous with the drainage from her L great toe, she also noted increasing pain from the lateral aspect of the plantar surface of her left forefoot, especially when walking. She denies any trauma to her left foot. She reports that the ulcer on her right lateral foot is stable, and she has been dressing it with Panafil ointment as prescribed by Dr. Salgado. She denies any rest pain, and reports that her prior claudication is almost fully resolved following her R SFA angioplasty last year. She presented today to Dr. Salgado&#8217;s clinic for routine follow-up, when wet gangrene of her L great toe was detected on clinical exam. Furthermore, she underwent repeat A-LENIs that demonstrated a major decline in the ABI of her R leg, suggestive of worsening peripheral vascular disease. She is now admitted for parenteral antibiotics and amputation of the L great toe and debridement of the R forefoot ulcer.",

She has a h/o several admisions to the hospital for abdominal pain attributed to diabetic gastroparesis. She has had an extensive GI work-up in the past including multiple abdominal CT scans, gastric emptying study, colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and small bowel follow through. All studies were negative except for the gastric emptying study. She has been treated with multiple medications, including Reglan, Ativan, Compazine, and Zelnorm without much effect. She is currently taking Neurontin and Cymbalta to treat neuropathic pain, and her PCP started her on MS Contin in December since nothing else seemed to be helping. The pt states that the MS Contin helped during the month of December, but then it did not seem to be working as well. The pt is distraught over her symptoms because the pain is severe and frequent. She has been unable to return to work for 2 years because of the pain, and she would like to be able to do so. The pain is not necessarily related to eating. Yesterday, she felt well and was able to eat. Today, she was doing fine until she had to drink the gastrografin, and then it escalated to an 8/10. She received some IV morphine, and now it is down to 4/10.",

We will order CTA of the abdomen to rule this out.

She is extremely difficult to diurese because of her tenuous renal function, this required multiple adjustments of her medication. Stress test showed no ischemia and echocardiogram showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal chamber size and systolic function, estimated ejection fraction is 65% as well as biatrial enlargement . She did well acutely with BiPAP and remains on oxygen. As part of her workup, she had pulmonary function tests, which showed moderate obstruction without a bronchodilator response and some mild restriction likely due to her obesity. In addition, she was quite anemic with hematocrit of 19 on presentation. There was no evidence of hemolysis. She is mildly iron deficient and colonoscopy showed a tubulovillous adenoma, which was excised as well as a short area of Barrett's esophagus. There was no evidence of active bleeding. She received multiple transfusions throughout her stay and was started on darbepoetin, for what was ultimately felt to be anemia of renal disease.

This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke. He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap. His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor. A hypercoagulability panel was negative. Homocysteine was normal. Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia. His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy. Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070. He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele. A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett. Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting. This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use. The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated.",

The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop. The tongue protrudes in the midline. The left arm is completely plegic.

There was no loss of consciousness and she was able to get up/ambulate after fall. Of note, she has switched from drinking 7 cans of diet coke per day to 7 cans of regular coke because the facility where she lives ran out of diet coke. She is also restricting her caloric intake and her meals consist of a croissant at breakfast, cottage cheese at lunch and an avocado for dinner, in attempt to lose weight. She has not had any recent medication changes. She denies recent fever, chills, CP, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria. She does report significant thirst and frequent urination.
